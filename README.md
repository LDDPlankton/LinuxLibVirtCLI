# LinuxLibVirtCLI

This project is not supported. It's simply a script that I built in C++ to work with the LibVirt API, so that I could easily manage a few of my dedicated servers and my suite of VPS's.

The project base code is solid and may be a good reference for others looking to build something similar, though Python would be a better choice.
